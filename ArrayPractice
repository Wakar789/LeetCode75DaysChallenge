	//What is Array?
	//Array is a collection of datatype
	//Datatype can be Premitive, non Premitive and Object anything
	//element should be of similar datatype so we can say that Array is the collection of similar datatype.
	
	//Syntax:
	
	//DataType[] VariableName = new DataType[size];  if you don't mention the size it will throw error.
	
	//DataType[] VarableName = {10,20,30,40};
	
	int[] arr = new int[5];
	// arr is reference variable ---> this happened during compile time
	//new int[5] =>creating object in heap memory --->this happened during run time : Dynamic Memory Allocation
	
	//In stack memory all the function call and reference memory will go
	
	//JVM manages the memory management
	
	//Arrays Object are stored in Heap
	//Heap Object are not continuous
	//Dynamic Memory Allocation
	//Hence May not be continuous : Depends on JVM
	
	//new is used to create a Object
